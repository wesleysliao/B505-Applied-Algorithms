    Create a boolean nxn matrix that records if jobs are compatible.
    The matrix values C[i][j] will be 1 if job i occurs before job j and does not overlap.
    Divide-and-conquer to find the longest path along compatible jobs.

   This keeps a table of previously computed probabilies and only computes the unknown probabilities.

   initialze P[0...n][0...n] to all -1
   P[0][1...n] <- 1
   P[1...n][0] <- 0

   to find probability of win with i, j games played:
   win_prob(i, j):
    q = n - i
    r = n - j
    if P[q][r] != -1:
      return P[q][r]
    else:
      P[q][r] = (0.5 * win_prob(i + 1, j)) + (0.5 * win_prob(i, j+1))
      return P[q][r]
